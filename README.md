**The Cool Integration for Xmas, Secret Santa with WhatsApp!**

This Secret Santa integration with WhatsApp was an idea to play with friends. All you need is a fresh phone number and WA Business Account that you can create in Meta. Just search WhatsApp API and you'll find it. 

If anyone would like to help the project, I would be grateful if you could make pull requests on what I still have pending, to enrich this project.
